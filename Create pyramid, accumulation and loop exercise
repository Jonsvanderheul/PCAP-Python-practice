# Scenario
# Listen to this story: a boy and his father, a computer programmer, are playing with
#     wooden blocks. They are building a pyramid.
#
# Their pyramid is a bit weird, as it is actually a pyramid-shaped wall - it's flat. '
# 'The pyramid is stacked according to one simple principle: each lower layer contains one block more than the layer above.
#
# The figure illustrates the rule used by the builders:
#
#
#
# Your task is to write a program which reads the number of blocks the builders have,
# and outputs the height of the pyramid that can be built using these blocks.
#
# Note: the height is measured by the number of fully completed layers - if the builders
# don't have a sufficient number of blocks and cannot complete the next layer, they finish their work immediately.
#
# Test your code using the data we've provided.
#
#
# Test Data
#
# Sample input: 6
#
# Expected output: The height of the pyramid: 3
#
# Sample input: 20
#
# Expected output: The height of the pyramid: 5
#
# Sample input: 1000
#
# Expected output: The height of the pyramid: 44
#
# Sample input: 2
#
# Expected output: The height of the pyramid: 1
