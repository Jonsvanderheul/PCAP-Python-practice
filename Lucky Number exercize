#Scenario
#A junior magician has picked a secret number. He has hidden it in a variable named secret_number. 
#He wants everyone who run his program to play the Guess the secret number game, and guess what number he has picked for them. 
#Those who don't guess the number will be stuck in an endless loop forever! Unfortunately, he does not know how to complete the code.

#Your task is to help the magician complete the code in the editor in such a way so that the code:

#will ask the user to enter an integer number;
#will use a while loop;
#will check whether the number entered by the user is the same as the number picked by the magician. 

#Version 1: i got the loop working, but adding another while loop with a countdown did not yet succeed.

secret_number = 777
