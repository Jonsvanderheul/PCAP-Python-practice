# Building a guessing game as a while-loop exercise.
# In version 1 a simple loop, only to be broken by the right guess.
# In the next version a counter with a max of 3 guesses.
# For this I am using a library called 'random', it generates 
# a random number in a given range if coupled with .randrange
# Thanks to GeekTutorials Australia for the help on this one.

# version 1:

# import random
#
# number = random.randrange(1, 10)
# guess = int(input("your guess:"))
#
# while guess != number:
#     print("Sorry you guessed wrong, try again. \n")
#     guess = int(input("your guess:"))
#
# print("congratulations, you have guessed the number"

# Version 2: with a counter of max 3, a countdown is added in the same loop.
import random

number = random.randrange(1, 10)
counter = 3
guess = int(input("your guess:"))

import random

number = random.randrange(1, 10)
counter = 3
guess = int(input("your guess:"))

while guess != number:
    counter -= 1
    if guess == number:
        print("congratulations, you have guessed the number")
    elif counter == 0:
        print("sorry, you have guessed too many times. Game over.")
        quit()
    else:
        print("Sorry you guessed wrong, try again. \n")
        print(counter, "guesses left.")
        guess = int(input("your guess:"))
