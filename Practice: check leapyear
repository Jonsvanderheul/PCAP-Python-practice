# Short exercize to buid a small program to check if a year is a leap year or not.
# From Module 3 of the PCAP Python Programming Essentials, Cisco NetAcad.

# Scenario
# As you surely know, due to some astronomical reasons, years may be leap or common. The former are 366 days
# long, while the latter are 365 days long.
#
# Since the introduction of the Gregorian calendar (in 1582), the following rule is used to determine the kind
# of year:
#
# if the year number isn't divisible by four, it's a common year;
# otherwise, if the year number isn't divisible by 100, it's a leap year;
# otherwise, if the year number isn't divisible by 400, it's a common year;
# otherwise, it's a leap year.
# Look at the code in the editor - it only reads a year number, and needs to be completed with the instructions
# implementing the test we've just described.
#
# The code should output one of two possible messages, which are Leap year or Common year, depending on the value
# entered.
#
# It would be good to verify if the entered year falls into the Gregorian era, and output a warning otherwise:
# Not within the Gregorian calendar period. Tip: use the != and % operators.
#
# Test your code using the data we've provided.

# Version 1: first try

# year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
#
# division_1 = 4
# division_2 = 400
# division_3 = 100
#
# if year < 1582:
#     print("Not within the Gregorian calendar")
#     exit()
#
# if year % division_1 != 0:
#     if year % division_2 != 0:
#         print("This year is a common year")
#     elif year % division_3 != 0:
#         print("This year is a leap year")
# else:
#     print("This year is a leap year")

# Antwoord cursus:

# year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
#
# if year < 1582:
# 	print("Not within the Gregorian calendar period")
# else:
# 	if year % 4 != 0:
# 		print("Common year")
# 	elif year % 100 != 0:
# 		print("Leap year")
# 	elif year % 400 != 0:
# 		print("Common year")
# 	else:
# 		print("Leap year")


# Version 2: 16-03-2021
